Reversed Tic Tac Toe in C#

Welcome to our project! This is a C# implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, with a twist - the player who first gets a sequence (row/column/diagonal) loses. The game includes a command-line interface and allows for both player-vs-player and player-vs-computer game modes.
